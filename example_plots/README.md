### Example data and plots
Example data (manually created so does not represent a real player) is
available in the `example-player-hiscores.csv` file.

The jupyter notebook, `OSRS_hiscores_example_plots.ipynb`, reads this example
data and outputs three plots, as done in the main `OSRS_hiscores.py` script.

These plots are:
- plotly_overall_stats.png.  This gives an overview of the player stats and
boss kill count. An interactive version of this plot is created in the
notebook and `OSRS_hiscores.py` script.
- seaborn_facetgrid_killcount.png. Displays each boss killcount on a facetgrid.
- seaborn_facetgrid_skills.png. Displays each skill level on a facetgrid.
