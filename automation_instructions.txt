The OSRS_hiscores.py script can be run automatically by your operating system
to save manually running each day. This gives a better overview of the stat
progression.
Instructions to do this using Windows and Linux are below. Unfortunately, I
have no access to a Mac so no support is foreseen.

-------------------------------
Windows:
A template automation.bat batch file is provided.
The automation.bat file requires some minor edits for it to work:
1.  Edit the "path" variable to the absolute path of the OSRS_hiscores
    directory.
2.  Replace "C:\Python39\python.exe" with the absolute path to your python
    installation executable.
3.  Replace "C:\user\OSRS_hiscores\OSRS_hiscores.py" with the absolute
    path to the OSRS_hiscores.py script.

Once the above is complete, the batch file is ready.
To run it once per day, open the "Task Scheduler" and follow the below
instructions:
1.  Click "Create Basic Task..."
2.  Enter a name and description. Click "Next >".
3.  Choose a frequency to run the script. Click "Next >".
4.  Choose a start time. Click "Next >".
5.  Ensure "Start a program" is checked. Click "Next >".
6.  In "Program/script:", set the path to the automation.bat file. Click
    "Next >".
7.  Check details are correct. Click "Finish".

Your system is now setup to automatically run the program.

Linux:
Warning: this software has not yet been tested on Linux (planned in future).
To automatically run the OSRS_hiscores.py script, use a cron job.
